Hi there! I'm Adarsh, a second-year engineering student with a growing passion for web development. While 3D modeling has been my creative outlet for some time, I'm excited to explore the dynamic world of coding and its power to build interactive experiences.

**My Skills & Interests:**

* **HTML & CSS:** I'm currently diving into the fundamentals of web structure and design, eager to bring static pages to life.
* **JavaScript:** The world of interactivity awaits! I'm just starting my exploration of this powerful language, and I'm fascinated by its potential.
* **3D Modeling:** Still a part of my creative toolkit, I enjoy crafting engaging models in my free time.

**Where I'm Headed:**

My journey in web development is just beginning, and I'm excited to learn, grow, and contribute. I'm open to collaboration, mentorship opportunities, and any challenges that can help me hone my skills and build awesome things.
